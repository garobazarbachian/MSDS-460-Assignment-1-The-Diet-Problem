NWU MSDS 460 (Individual) Assignment 1: Linear Programming Example---The Diet Problem Revisited (Spring 2024)

Having recently succumbed to the allure of Trader Joe's, I found myself drawn to utilizing their diverse array of food items for my initial assignment. What captivates me about Trader Joe's is their expansive selection, offering everything from humble rice dishes to indulgent Portuguese custard tarts. For this assignment, I selected five distinct food items: Japanese-Style Fried Rice, Chicken Burrito Bowl, and Blackened Salmon, along with additional grocery essentials such as Pasture-raised Large Brown Eggs and Greek Nonfat Yogurt. In the Product Shots folder you can find screenshots of the nutrional facts for each food item and my calculations for pricing. 

The pricing methodology employed to determine the cost per serving is outlined in Appendix B. This process involves multiplying the serving size in grams by the number of servings per item to ascertain the total weight in grams. Subsequently, dividing the serving size in grams by the total weight yields a decimal value, which is then multiplied by the price of the entire item to derive the cost per serving.
